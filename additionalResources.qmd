## R and RStudio Helpful Resources

* [Download: R from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
    - This is where you can download the R language software for FREE for your own computer.
    - Choose your operating system (Mac OS or Windows or Linux/Unix)
    - NOTE: For Windows, you should also download and install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/) - this is technically optional, but is useful to have. Make sure to download the one for your R version.
* [Download: RStudio IDE Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
    - Note: Windows is listed at the top - just scroll down to see the installer for the Mac OS as well. There are also installers for the versions of Linux/Unix.

## Other places to get HELP

* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    - I encourage you to create an account so you can post questions. But even without an account you can search for and find answers to your questions and error messages.
* [Google](https://www.google.com/)
    - You can often cut and paste error messages in Google to find answers - most likely will redirect you to Stack Overflow. 
* Package vignettes for packages on CRAN
    - Here is [one vignette for dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html)
    - These will often help you get started.
* Github package issues
    - Many packages will host their code on Github which includes an "issues" tab. This can be a good place to see what other problems people may be having with a given package.
    - [dplyr issues on Github](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues)
* CRAN package site
    - [dplyr on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html) - spend time looking at:
        - the [README](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/readme/README.html) for the package or
        - [bug reports](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues) or
        - [NEWS](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/news/news.html) which will detail the changes for each version updates
* [R Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)
    - This is a really good website which curates thousands of people who are R developers, users and programmers who post articles about R.
