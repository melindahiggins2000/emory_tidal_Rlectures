## R and RStudio Helpful Resources

* [Download: R from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
    - This is where you can download the R language software for FREE for your own computer.
    - Choose your operating system (Mac OS or Windows or Linux/Unix)
    - NOTE: For Windows, you should also download and install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/) - this is technically optional, but is useful to have. Make sure to download the one for your R version.
* [Download: RStudio IDE Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
